        <p>The Memorial Hall in Padstow (Formally the Seaman's Mission) was taken over by a new
        committee in February 2013. The building was in very bad state of repair with the chimney
        and flat roof to the rear of the building leaking very badly, the existing windows were rotten
        and in need of replacing together with heating system and electrical rewire.</p>
        <p>With the money we had within the accounts from many varied fund raising events and
        together with donations from individuals and the Town Council it was decided by the new
        committee to embark on a much needed updating, maintenance and repair programme so
        that the many users of the Memorial Hall can have an enhanced experience and use of up to
        date facilities.</p>
        <p>Following the extensive programme of works the committee has achieved making the
        building fully water tight repairing the chimney and flat roofs, many of the windows have
        been replaced with double glazed units and new insulation has been incorporated to save
        energy and reduce the running costs of the building. We have replaced the old heating
        system with a new Gas Fired Boiler and radiators. The disabled access issue has been
        addressed and we have constructed new toilets that include full disabled facilities.</p>
